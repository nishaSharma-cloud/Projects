# Image Preprocessing: 
This project imports an image and performs various preprocessing on the image, like converting 2 channel images to 3 channels, greyscale conversion, Min-Max normalization, Image augmentation, Flipping the image, rotating the image, and brightness variation. These steps help in generating more nuances of a small dataset.
  * Images are imported using skimage 
  * Performed preprocessing like:
    * 2 channel images to 3 channel images using NumPy
    * Converting to grayscale using skimage
    * Normalizing using Min-Max normalization
    * Shifting the image using Keras
    * Flipping, Rotating, changing brightness and standardizing the image using Keras

# Technology stack:
  * TensorFlow
  * Keras
  * os
  * Glob
  * skimage
  * Random
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
