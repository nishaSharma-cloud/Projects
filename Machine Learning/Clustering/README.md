# Basic Clustering: 
  * This project manual differentiate given points and create clusters using squared euclidean distance to calculate distance and continously updating the centroid after each addition of a point in a cluster. Finally plots all the clusters on a graph.
  * We read the given data from a csv file into a data frame.
  * Perform Min-Max Normalisation on all the given points.
  * Create cluters of the given points and assign a new point to a cluster based on squared Euclidean distance
  * Update the centroid of the cluster post addition of new point
  * Plot them using differnet symbol and colors for each clusters

# Technology Stack:
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * matplotlib
