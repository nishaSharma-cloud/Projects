# Basic Clustering: 
  * This project manual differentiates given points and creates clusters using squared Euclidean distance to calculate distance and continuously updating the centroid after each addition of a point in a cluster. Finally plots all the clusters on a graph.
  * We read the given data from a csv file into a data frame.
  * Perform Min-Max Normalization on all the given points.
  * Create clusters of the given points and assign a new point to a cluster based on squared Euclidean distance
  * Update the centroid of the cluster post addition of a new point
  * Plot them using different symbols and colors for each cluster

# Technology Stack:
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * matplotlib
