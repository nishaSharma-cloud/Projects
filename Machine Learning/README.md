## Machine Learning

This folder contains 5 subfolders.
* Clustering: This project manual differentiate given points and create clusters using squared euclidean distance to calculate distance and continously updating the centroid after each addition of a point in a cluster. Final plots all the clusters on a graph.
* Image Preprocessing: This project imports an image and perform various preprocessing on the image, like converting 2 channel image to 3 channel, grey scale conversion, Min-Max normalization, Image augmentation, Flipping the image, rotating the image, brightness variation. These steps helps in generating more nuances of a small dataset.
* PCA: This project manually calculates the principal components of a given set of numbers. Normalise them, calculate eigen vectors and eigen values for them. Reconstruct the data set again with the new identified Principal component and eventually plot them agains the old points. Also calculates the error introducted.
* Multilabel: This project classifies an image using soft classification where a movie poster can be categorized based on movie genre.
* Regression: This project predicts the price of houses in bangalore based on location,sqft,bath and bhk, it compare 3 models for the classification and finds linear regression perform the best.
