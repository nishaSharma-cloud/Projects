# Principal Component Analysis: 
This project manually calculates the principal components of a given set of numbers. 
* We first Normalize the given points
* Calculate eigen vectors and eigen values for the given points. 
* Reconstruct the data set again with the new identified Principal component 
* Eventually plot them against the old points. 
* Finally calculate the error introduced.

# Technology Stack:
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
