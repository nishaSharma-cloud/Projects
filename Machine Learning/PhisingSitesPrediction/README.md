# Predicting Phishing Sites
This project identifies whether or not a given website is a phishing website based on web rank, page traffic URL length, and many more parameters.
* We read the data using pandas from CSV
* Data is checked for null values
* The target column is separated from the data, and it is split into train and test data
* The prediction is made using models:
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * KNN
  * Naive Bayes
* The Results are evaluated on:
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * Accuracy
  * F1 Score

# Technology Stack:
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Keras
* Sklearn
* Seaborn
