# Naive Bayes
This project contains the logic to perform Gaussian Naive Bayes on top of a given set of data where features are extracted using withColumn.
* Fruit's color and taste along with edibility are stored as inputs in a list
* Using withColumn of data frame the features are created 
* The label is then encoded
* Using Gaussian naive Bayes, the final prediction is made if a given fruit is edible or not based on its color and taste
