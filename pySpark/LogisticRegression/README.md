# Logistic Regression
This Project contains Logistic regression on a given set of a number using Rformula.
* We read the data from CSV files
* The data contains various features based on which we need to predict whether or not a given animal is a mammal or not.
* We utilize RFormula to create feature columns and labels
* We use logistic regression to fit and test the model
* And predict if a given animal is a mammal or not.

# Technology stack:
