The Simple English Wikipedia is an English-language edition of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia written primarily in Basic English and Special English. It was launched in 2001. It is one of nine Wikipedias written in an Anglic language or English-based pidgin/creole, the others being the English Wikipedia, the Scots Wikipedia, the Old English Wikipedia, the Pitkern-Norfuk Wikipedia, the Tok Pisin Wikipedia, the Jamaican Patois Wikipedia, the Nostalgia Wikipedia, and the Sranan Tongo Wikipedia. The site has the stated aim of providing an encyclopedia for "people with different needs, such as students, children, adults with learning difficulties, and people who are trying to learn English". As of January 2021, the site contains over 179,000 content pages, and has more than 1,055,000 registered users, of whom 1,153 are currently active.
Simple English Wikipedia's basic presentation style makes it ideal for beginners learning English. Its simpler word structure and syntax, while detracting from the raw information standpoint, can make the information easy to understand. Material from the Simple English Wikipedia forms the basis for One Encyclopedia per Child, a One Laptop per Child project.
The articles on the Simple English Wikipedia are usually shorter than their English Wikipedia counterparts, typically presenting only basic information. Tim Dowling of The Guardian newspaper explained that "the Simple English version tends to stick to commonly accepted facts". The interface is also more simply labeled; for instance, the "Random article" link on the English Wikipedia is replaced with a "Show any page" link; users are invited to "change" rather than "edit" pages; clicking on a red link shows a "page not created" message rather than the usual "page does not exist". The project uses around 1,500 common English words, and is based on Basic English, an 850-word controlled natural language created by Charles Kay Ogden in the 1920s.
