# Word Generator

This folder contains a project which helps in generating words using the probability of words in the input file. And eventually, compare the probability of original words with the probability of generated words in terms of word length.

* Generated file: contains the words generated from the program
* Probability distribution: contains the probability plot
* Sample simple English wiki: contains the input text
* Word generator: contains the program logic of this project
* A text file containing sample text is read as input
* Each word's probability is calculated using the number of occurrences of that word by a total number of words in the text.
* Post calculation of cumulative probability words are randomly generated using a random number and extracting characters based on those random numbers
* Probability of generated words is plotted against the original words in the final step

# Technology Stack:
* Random
* Regex
* Matplotlib
